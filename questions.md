### Question 18 (IMG_9049) - Crack the Cipher
**Question**: You have intercepted a series of coded messages, and you realize they all follow the same pattern. Here are a few examples:
- "QQQQ" decodes to "CODE"
- "ECWE" decodes to "DATA"

Using the same pattern, what does the coded message "DQPF" decode to?

**Options**:
- A. HELLO
- B. HELP (Based on pattern Q->C (-14?), Q->O (-2?), wait. Let's look closer. Q(17) -> C(3) is -14. Q->O(15) is -2. This seems complex or maybe simple shift. Q(17)-C(3) = 14 diff. E(5)-D(4)=1. C(3)-A(1)=2. W(23)-T(20)=3. E(5)-A(1)=4. 
Pattern seems: -1, -2, -3, -4?
Let's check QQQQ -> CODE.
Q(17) - 14 = C(3). This doesn't fit a simple linear shift.
Let's re-examine image 9049.
QQQQ -> CODE
E C W E -> D A T A
D(4) A(1) T(20) A(1)
E(5) C(3) W(23) E(5)
E->D (-1)
C->A (-2)
W->T (-3)
E->A (-4)
Okay, the pattern is shifting back by 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.
Let's apply to DQPF.
D(4) - 1 = C(3) -> C? No option starts with C.
Wait, let's check QQQQ -> CODE.
Q(17) -> C(3) (-14).
Q(17) -> O(15) (-2).
Q(17) -> D(4) (-13).
Q(17) -> E(5) (-12).
Maybe it's + values?
D(4) -> E(5) (+1)
A(1) -> C(3) (+2)
T(20) -> W(23) (+3)
A(1) -> E(5) (+4)
Ah, the *coded* message is the source. "ECWE" decodes *to* "DATA". So DATA + shifts = ECWE.
So we need to reverse the operation on DQPF to find the plain text.
D(4) -> -2 ? D=4. 4-2=2(B).
D(4) -> ?
Let's look at the options: HELLO, HELP, WORLD, HEDGE.
H(8) + 2 = J?
Let's try Shift +2, +4, +6?
DATA: D(4)+1=E(5). A(1)+2=C(3). T(20)+3=W(23). A(1)+4=E(5). Correct.
Message "DQPF" is the *coded* message. We need to go back.
D(4) - 2 = B (2). No.
Maybe the shift starts at 2?
Let's try "Q O Q Q" vs "CODE".
C(3)+14=17(Q).
O(15)+2=17(Q).
D(4)+13=17(Q).
E(5)+12=17(Q).
This is weird.
Let's ignore deciphering and just transcribe.
Options: HELLO, HELN, WORLD, HEDGE.

**Answer**: B. HELN? Or HELP? 
Let's try "DQPF".
D(4) - 2 = B.
D(4) + ? = H(8)? +4.
Q(17) -> E(5) (-12).
P(16) -> L(12) (-4).
F(6) -> P? or L? or N?
Let's assume the question asks to decode "DQPF".
If H(8) -> D(4) (-4?)
E(5) -> Q(17) (+12?)
L(12) -> P(16) (+4)
P(16) -> F(6) (-10)
This seems hard to solve on the fly without scratching paper. I will just list the options and select what looks like valid output if I can or leave it blank/marked.
Actually, let's look at the options again in the image.
A. HELLO
B. HELN
C. WORLD
D. HEDGE
I will check the "Answer Options" radio button selected in the image if any... none selected.
Wait, let's look at the image 9049 again.
Actually, let's just transcribe the question and options.

**Options**:
- A. HELLO
- B. HELN
- C. WORLD
- D. HEDGE

**Answer**: (Not visible, will leave for user to solve or guess context. Based on "ECWE" -> "DATA" (+1, +2, +3, +4 reverse), 
D(4) - 2 = B?
Let's try +2 shift?
C(3)+2=E(5). O(15)+2=Q(17). D(4)+2=F? No, QQQQ.
It says "QQQQ decodes to CODE".
C(3) -> Q(17) (+14). O(15)->Q(17) (+2). D(4)->Q(17) (+13). E(5)->Q(17) (+12).
Doesn't look consistent.
Let's look at "ECWE" -> "DATA".
D->E (+1), A->C (+2), T->W (+3), A->E (+4).
This works.
So Pattern is: Plain[i] + (i+1) = Cipher[i].
We have Cipher "DQPF".
P[0] + 1 = D(4) => P[0] = 3 (C).
P[1] + 2 = Q(17) => P[1] = 15 (O).
P[2] + 3 = P(16) => P[2] = 13 (M).
P[3] + 4 = F(6) => P[3] = 2 (B).
COMB? Not an option.
Maybe the pattern continues or wraps?
Let's try "DQPF" as P[0]+2=D?
Let's guess "B. HELN" is actually "B. HELP"? P(16).
H(8)+? = D(4). -4.
E(5)+? = Q(17). +12.
L(12)+? = P(16). +4.
P(16)+? = F(6). -10.
I will just transcribe.

**Question**: A network flags a reading if it is prime and less than 30 or a multiple of 6 less than 30. Which readings are flagged?

**Options**:
- A. {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 29}
- B. {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}
- C. {6, 12, 18, 24}
- D. {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 30}

**Answer**: A. {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 29}
(Primes < 30: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Multiples of 6 < 30: 6, 12, 18, 24. Combined set matches A).

### Question 2 (IMG_9053) - If-Else Ladder
**Question**: What is the output of the following code?
```python
x, y = 6, 9
msg = ""

if (x % 2 == 0) and (y % 3 == 0):
    msg += "A"
if (x + y) % 5 == 0:
    msg += "B"
elif (x - y) % 2 == 1:
    msg += "C"
else:
    msg += "D"
msg += "E"
print(msg)
```
*Analysis*:
- `x=6`, `y=9`.
- `if (x % 2 == 0) and (y % 3 == 0)`: 6%2==0 (True), 9%3==0 (True). So `msg += "A"` (msg="A").
- `if (x + y) % 5 == 0`: 15%5==0 (True). `msg += "B"` (msg="AB").
- `elif` ... is skipped because `if` branch taken.
- `else` ... is skipped.
- `msg += "E"` (msg="ABE").
- Print "ABE".

**Options**:
- A. AB
- B. AC
- C. D
- D. AE (Wait, options are A: AB, B: AC, C: D, D: AE... where is "ABE"?
Ah, I might be reading the indentation wrong or the logic wrong.
`if` ... `msg+="A"`.
`if (x+y)%5 == 0`: ... `msg+="B"`.
`elif (x-y)%2 == 1`: ... `msg+="C"`.
Let's check if `elif` is attached to the second `if`. Yes, usually.
So if second `if` is True, `elif` is skipped.
Wait, let me look at the image options again.
Options visible: AB, AC, D, AE.
Maybe I misread the code.
`if (x+y)%5 == 0`: 15%5==0. True. Append B.
So msg is "AB".
Then `msg += "E"`. So "ABE".
BUT "ABE" is not an option!
Let's re-read the first `if`.
`if (x % 2 == 0) and (y % 3 == 0)` -> True.
Maybe `msg` is overwritten? No `msg +=`.
Maybe `elif` condition is checked? No, `elif` is exclusively with `if`.
Is it possible `x % 2 != 0`? No, 6 is even.
Is it possible `y % 3 != 0`? No, 9 is multiple of 3.
Is `(x+y)%5` not 0? 15. Yes it is.
Maybe the indentation is different.
`if ...: msg+="A"`
`if ...: msg+="B"`
`elif ...: msg+="C"`
`else: msg="D"` (Wait, maybe it is msg = "D", no `+`).
`msg += "E"`
If the second `if` is executed, `msg` becomes "AB". Then "ABE".
What if the first `if` is *not* met? No, it is met.
What if `print` is indented? No, looks dedented.
Let's check the options again carefully.
A. AB
B. AC
C. D
D. AE
Is it possible "AB" is the answer and "E" is not appended? No, `msg += "E"` is there.
Maybe the first condition is `x % 2 != 0`? No, logic `x%2==0` is standard.
Maybe the values are different? x=6, y=9.
Maybe the operator is different? `(x * y) % 5`? 54 % 5 = 4. != 0.
If that's the case:
First if: True -> "A".
Second if: False.
Elif: `(x - y) % 2 == 1`. (6-9) = -3. -3 % 2 = 1? In Python -3 % 2 is 1. True.
So `msg += "C"`. msg="AC".
Then `msg += "E"`. Result "ACE".
"AC" is an option. But where is E?
Maybe the last line `msg += "E"` is inside the `else` block?
If `msg += "E"` is indented under `else`, then it wouldn't run if `elif` ran.
Let's look at the image indentation.
`else:`
`    msg += "D"`
`    msg = "E"` (Maybe it's `msg = "E"` overwriting?)
Or `msg += "E"` is aligned with `if`.
If `msg += "E"` is aligned with `else`, then "AC" would be the output?
Wait, if `elif` runs, `else` doesn't. So `msg += "E"` wouldn't run if it was in `else`.
If `msg += "E"` is global, it runs always.
Let's check option B: "AC". This implies A and C were added, and E was NOT added (or overwritten?).
If the code is:
```python
if ...:
    msg += "B"
    msg += "E" # Inside if?
```
No.
Maybe `(x+y)%5` is False?
6+9=15.
Maybe it is `(x*y)%5`?
Maybe `msg` is printed inside the conditional?
Let's look at the indentation of `print(msg)`. It looks dedented.
And `msg += "E"` looks dedented too, same level as the if/else tower.
So E should be there.
Is it possible `x=6, y=8`? No, 9.
Is it possible `y%3 != 0`?
Maybe the option is "ACE" but truncated? Or "ABE"?
Let's look at the options again.
A. AB
B. AC
C. D
D. AE
If the answer is "AC", then "E" is missing.
If the answer is "AB", "E" is missing.
This implies `msg += "E"` is NOT executed or doesn't add E.
Or maybe `msg += "E"` is inside the `else` block?
Let's look at the indentation of `msg += "E"`.
`else:`
    `msg += "D"`
    `msg += "E"`
It looks like `msg += "E"` is aligned with `print(msg)`, which looks less indented than `msg += "D"`.
Let's guess. If the intended answer is among the choices, and "ACE" or "ABE" are not there, maybe `msg += "E"` is not there?
Wait, I see `msg += "E"` clearly.
Maybe `msg` is reset? `msg = "E"`?
No, `msg += "E"`.
Maybe `print(msg)` is `print(msg[0:2])`? No.
Maybe the question asks for output BEFORE E? No.
Let's assume the question has a mistake or "E" is inside an else.
If `msg += "E"` is inside `else`:
Then since `elif` is hit (assuming second `if` is False), `else` is skipped. So no E.
"AC".
But why is second `if` False? `(x+y)%5 == 0`. 15%5 is 0.
So it should be "B".
Then "AB".
If "AB" is option A...
And if `msg += "E"` is inside `else`...
Then if `if` (B) is taken, `else` is skipped. So no E. output "AB".
If `if` (B) is NOT taken (e.g. if code was `x*y`), then `elif` (C) is taken. output "AC".
So either AB or AC.
Let's check the code image really closely.
`if (x + y) % 5 == 0:`
    `msg += "B"`
`elif ...`
`else ...`
`msg += "E"` (This line looks indented same as `msg += "D"`? No, it looks vertically aligned with `if`.
Actually, looking at `IMG_9053` zoom... `msg += "E"` is aligned with `if`.
So E should be appended.
So output should be "ABE" or "ACE".
Since neither is an option, maybe I am misreading the code entirely.
Maybe `msg = ...` at start of loop? No loop.
Maybe `x % 2 == 1`?
If x=6, x%2=0.
Let's skip over-analyzing and just transcribe.

**Options**:
- A. AB (Assuming E not added?)
- B. AC
- C. D
- D. AE

**Answer**: (Ambiguous, likely A or B depending on indent/typo).

### Question 3 (IMG_9054) - Dictionary Defaulters
**Question**: What is the output of the following code?
```python
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
print(d.get('c', d.get('a') + d.get('b')))
```
*Analysis*: `d.get('c')` is not found, so it returns default. Default is `d.get('a') + d.get('b')` = 1 + 2 = 3.
So prints 3.

**Options**:
- A. None
- B. 0
- C. 3
- D. KeyError

**Answer**: C. 3

---

### Question 4 (IMG_9055) - While Loops
**Question**: What is the output of the following code?
```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```
*Analysis*:
i=0. Loop. i->1. 1!=3. Print 1.
i=1. Loop. i->2. 2!=3. Print 2.
i=2. Loop. i->3. 3==3. Break.
Output: 1, 2. (Wait, print is typically newline separated).
If options are scalar counts or `1 2`?
Options:
- A. 2
- B. 3
- C. 4
- D. 5

Option values: 2, 3, 4, 5.
Wait, "What is the output...?" usually lists the output.
Maybe the question asks "What is the LAST number printed?" or "How many times print is called?" or the options are distinct outputs.
Let's look at the image options.
Option A: 2 (Radio button label "2").
Option B: 3.
Option C: 4.
Option D: 5.
Maybe it asks "What is the value of i after loop?" No, "output".
If output is `1\n2`, maybe the "2" option represents the last value?
Or maybe `print(i)` is outside the loop?
Indentation: `print(i)` is indented inside `while`.
So it prints 1, 2.
Maybe "2" means "Outputs 1 and 2"? Or implies the final value.
Or maybe `if i == 3: break` is indented differently?
If `print(i)` is after break?
Logic:
i=0 -> inc to 1 -> check -> print 1.
i=1 -> inc to 2 -> check -> print 2.
i=2 -> inc to 3 -> check (True) -> break.
So 1, 2.
The only logical answer among options representing "what happens" is 2 (as in, stops at 2).
I will assume A.

**Answer**: A. 2 (Last printed value)

### Question 5 (IMG_9056) - Set Difference
**Question**: What is the output of the following code?
```python
s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {2, 3, 4}
s3.add(4) # Wait, s3 is not defined?
# Ah, probably s1.add(4)? or s3 = ...?
# Image text:
# s1 = {1, 2, 3}
# s2 = {2, 3, 4}
# s1.add(4)
# s2.update({4, 5})
# print(len(s1 ^ s2))
```
*Analysis*:
s1 initially {1, 2, 3}. `s1.add(4)` -> {1, 2, 3, 4}.

### Question 6 (IMG_9057) - Algorithmic Slices
**Question**: What is the output of the following code?
```python
s = "algorithm"
print(s[-2:1:-2])
```
*Analysis*:
String: "algorithm" (index 0 to 8).
`s[-2]` is 'h' (index 7).
Stop is `1` (index 1, 'l').
Step is `-2`.
Start 'h' (7).
Next 7-2=5 ('t').
Next 5-2=3 ('o').
Next 3-2=1 (Stop at 1, exclusive).
So 'h', 't', 'o'.
Result "hto".

**Options**:
- A. ho
- B. hoi
- C. tpl
- D. mtr

Wait, let's re-index.
012345678
algorithm
a l g o r i t h m
8: m
7: h
6: t
5: i
4: r
3: o
2: g
1: l
0: a

Start -2 ('h', idx 7).
Step -2.
Seq: 7, 5, 3.
Indices: 7('h'), 5('i'), 3('o').
Next would be 1 ('l'), but stop is 1 exclusive.
So "hio".
Options:
A. ho
B. hoi
C. tpi
D. mtr

Image options:
A. hlo? Hard to read.
B. hoi
C. tgl?
D. mh?
Let's zoom in on IMG_9057.
It matches "hoi".
Wait, `s[5]` is 'i'. Yes.
My previous calculation: 7('h'), 5('i'), 3('o').
"hio".
Option B looks like "hoi".
Is it `h` `o` `i` order?
7, 5, 3. h, i, o.
"hio".
Does option B say "hio"?
Or does the code say `s[-2::-2]`?
Let's look at the image code.
`print(s[-2:1:-2])`.
Correct.
Indices: 7, 5, 3.
Chars: s[7]='h', s[5]='i', s[3]='o'.
Result: "hio".
Is "hio" an option?
Looking really closely at option B... "hoi"?
Maybe I can't read the letters well.
let's check indices again.
a(0) l(1) g(2) o(3) r(4) i(5) t(6) h(7) m(8).
Correct.
Maybe slice is `s[-2:2:-2]`?
If stop is 2 ('g'): 7, 5, 3. Still 3 ('o') > 2. So "hio".
Maybe stop is 0?
Maybe the string is different? "algorithms"?
"algorithm" len 9.
If option B is "hoi", and I calculate "hio"... maybe I am swapping 'i' and 'o' position?
i is 5. o is 3.
7(h) -> 5(i) -> 3(o).
"hio".
Option B: "hoi".
Maybe I typed the string wrong? "algorithm".
a-l-g-o-r-i-t-h-m.
Maybe I should trust my read of "hio" vs "hoi".
Actually, I'll just write "hio" in the answer explanation.
Wait, let's look at the image option B again. It looks like "hil" or "hoi" or "hot".
Actually, looking at the crop 4, bottom left.
Option B: "hlo"?
Option C: "tgl"?
Option D: "rth"?
Let's try to assume the code is correct and I am misinterpreting the string.
What if `s[-2:]`?
Whatever. I will record the code and the verified output "hio".

**Answer**: (Calculated "hio", closest option might be B if typo).

### Question 9 (IMG_9060) - Palindrome String
**Question**: Complete the function `isPalindrome(s)` to check if the given string `s` is a palindrome.
- The function must return an INTEGER denoting whether the string is a palindrome or not. Return 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.
- The string will only consist of lowercase alphabets.

**Problem Statement**: Given a string s, find whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string which reads the same backwards and forwards.

**Function signature**:
```python
def isPalindrome(s):
    # Check if string matches its reverse
    return 1 if s == s[::-1] else 0
```

**Function signature**:
```python
import math

def averageExcludingExtremes(N, A):
    if N == 0:
        return 0
        
    min_val = min(A)
    max_val = max(A)
    
    filtered_A = [x for x in A if x != min_val and x != max_val]
    
    if not filtered_A:
        return 0
        
    avg = sum(filtered_A) / len(filtered_A)
    return math.floor(avg)
```

- If A=0 and B=2, then the product would be 0*1*1 = 0.

**Function signature**:
```python
def fibonacciProduct(A, B):
    if B < 0: return 0
    
    fibs = [0, 1]
    while len(fibs) <= B:
        fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
    
    product = 1
    for i in range(A, B + 1):
